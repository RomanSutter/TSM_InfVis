Reflection and Conclusion

To answer the main question of this poster, it can be said that money definitely makes to world go round.
But it is not just money as the results show. Social support and a long life expectancy also strongly influence
the feelings of the people all over the world. Regional averages support this conclusion and show clear 
differences based on the place of residence.
Working with this dataset was a big learning experience, both in the terms of understanding happiness, but also
in creating a visualization and applying the principles of the module hands-on. After cleaning the dataset and
first explorations, we realized that we needed to select a key message for the poster, since there is much more
to analyze and show than we could ever include in one page. The decision to choose python based tools for our 
project supported us with a lot of freedom but also useful libraries. The main tools where Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
and Plotly Express. The documentations and examples are helpful and provided a good structure for this project.
We enjoyed the learning process during this module task and were able to learn a lot about visualizing data in a 
productive way.
